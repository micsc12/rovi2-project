Meeeting notes, 9th of May 2017. 

Status: 
Vision status: Own implementation of simple linear kalman filter: 
We don't need to go for the extended kalman filter, but we could extend open the model (vel/acceleration). 
Dont go to crazy with the models though :)

2D uncertainties can be propagated into 3d uncertainty. Dirk approves.

For main topics, we need to go into detail.
